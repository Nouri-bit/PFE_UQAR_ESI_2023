# Internship Project - Mobile App Development with React Native, Node.js, Postgresql, and MongoDB

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my internship project proposed by the University of Quebec at Rimouski (UQAR) in Canada. This project focuses on the development of a mobile app using cutting-edge technologies, including React Native for the front-end, Node.js for the server, and both Postgresql and MongoDB as the databases, which are hosted on the cloud.

## Project Description
The main goal of this internship project is to create a feature-rich and user-friendly mobile app that caters to specific requirements set by the University of Quebec at Rimouski. The app is designed to serve as a platform for [specify the main purpose or functionality of the app]. It aims to provide an intuitive user experience and seamless interaction with the backend systems.

## Technologies Used
1. **React Native:** React Native allows us to build a cross-platform mobile app with a native-like user interface. It ensures a smooth performance and a consistent user experience on both Android and iOS devices.

2. **Node.js:** Node.js serves as the backend technology, providing a scalable and efficient server-side architecture. It allows us to handle various API requests, manage data, and facilitate communication between the app and databases.

3. **Postgresql:** As a relational database management system, Postgresql stores structured data in a robust and organized manner. It ensures data integrity and supports complex queries essential for the app's functionalities.

4. **MongoDB:** MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is chosen to handle unstructured data efficiently. Its flexibility and scalability enable seamless storage and retrieval of data.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `client`: This directory contains the React Native codebase for the mobile app's front-end.

- `server`: This directory houses the Node.js server code responsible for handling API requests and interacting with the databases.

## Installation and Setup
To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

2. Navigate to the `client` directory and install the required dependencies for the React Native app.
```
cd client
npm install
```

3. Similarly, navigate to the `server` directory and install the necessary Node.js packages.
```
cd ../server
npm install
```

4. Start the React Native development server.
```
npx react-native start
```

5. Launch the app on your Android or iOS emulator.
```
npx react-native run-android
# or
npx react-native run-ios
```

Please note that you will need appropriate access credentials for the cloud-hosted databases to run the app successfully.

## Conclusion
This internship project presents an exciting opportunity for me to gain practical experience in mobile app development using cutting-edge technologies. I am enthusiastic about creating a robust and efficient app that aligns with the University of Quebec at Rimouski's objectives.

Stay tuned for regular updates as I progress through the project development. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated!
